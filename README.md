# Kindler
A multi-tool with games and utilites I made for a Kindle Paperwhite while I was bored offline ;)

# Installation Instructions
To install, download the source code of this Github repository, extract the zip file and copy/paste the whole content inside the root directory of your kindle with your computer.

# Usage Guide
To use Kindler, simply launch the `Experimental Browser` app on your Kindle. Then, type in this URL: 
```bash
file:///mnt/us/index.html
```
After that, Kindler will be ready to use! Be sure to bookmark the page on your kindle to access it again!

# Disclaimer
This program is completely independent and unrelated to Amazon or its Kindle Paperwhite project. I created it purely out of boredom, without any negative intentions towards Amazon or its projects. It functions solely as a launcher for web apps utilizing ES5 Javascript loopholes. I want to emphasize that I have no desire to end up on Amazon's blacklist or engage in any harmful activities ðŸ˜….
